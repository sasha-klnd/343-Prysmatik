User account creation --> DONE
User prefernecies --> DONE

To Do :

When user is logged in, there is an option in the navbar "My Rides", 
user that offered the rides can see : the rides he's offering, the user that requested his 
rides (and their information, but NO CONTACT information of those users, so they could cut deals 
without the platform....), CTAs to delete a ride, modify a ride, Approve a user for the ride request 
(the number of the seats available should be updated, if resepected --> minus 1, if rejected, unchanged), 
Reject a user for the ride request (if no action is taken from the user offering a ride, the ride request 
is auto-rejected after 24 hours). The user that requested a ride can see : rides that he requested, status of 
his request (approved vs rejected), cancel a request, information about the user offering the ride 
(HOWEVER NO CONTACT INFORMATION). In addition, when a user request a ride, the user offering that 
ride should recieve an email (SMTP) saying that a user requested that ride. And once the user offering 
the ride reject or approve a user for the ride, the user requesting it should be notified by email too (SMTP).


Everything is working. DONE

Bugs :
When creating a ride, "Number of seats" don't update correctly. FIXED
On the My Rides screen, the number of requests don't update until user clicks on "View Requests". FIXED
User shouldn't be able to offer a ride in the past. FIXED
When ride is cancelled, the number of seats should be updated.

To Do : 
Implement the SMTP notification. DONE
Make the Desination and Departure fields a searchable field, where user have to select exactly an option.
Think of a policy for cancelation : 
    - What shuold happen when user (offering or requesting) cancel a ride?
    - Penalty?
